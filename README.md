# Number-Guessing-Game
This is a simple number guessing game that will allow user to have 5 attempts to guess the correct number generated by C++ rand function

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib> // For rand() and srand()
#include <ctime>   // For time()

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(time(0))); // Seed for random number generator
    int num = rand() % 100 + 1;  // Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    int number;                  // User input number
    int guess = 0;              // Counter for the number of guesses

    do
    {
        cout << "Enter a Number (between 1 and 100):\nYou can only make 5 incorrect guesses " << endl;
        cin >> number;

        if (number == num)
        {
            cout << "You guessed the correct number in " << guess + 1 << " attempts" << endl;
            break; // Exit the loop when the correct number is guessed
        }
        else
        {
            cout << "Your number is incorrect" << endl;
            guess += 1; // Increment the guess count
            cout << "Incorrect guess number: " << guess << endl;
            cout << "----------------------------------------------------------" << endl;
            if (guess == 5)
            {
                cout << "Oops! You've made 5 incorrect guesses. The correct number was " << num << ".\nProgram Terminated" << endl;
                break; // Terminate the program after 5 guesses
            }
        }

    } while (guess < 5); // Continue looping until the user makes 5 guesses

    return 0;
}
